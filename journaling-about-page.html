          <h2>Our Mission & Story</h2>
          <p>Our journaling platform was born from a simple belief: everyone deserves a private space to express themselves freely and authentically. Founded in 2008, we set out to create the most personalized, secure, and intuitive journaling experience available online.</p>
          <p>What started as a small project by a team of writers and developers who were passionate about journaling has grown into a platform trusted by millions worldwide. Our mission remains unchanged: to help people capture their thoughts, process emotions, and document their lives in a safe digital environment.</p>
          <p>Through consistent innovation and listening to our users, we've evolved while staying true to our core principles of privacy, simplicity, and personal growth.</p>
